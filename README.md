Sexism poses a significant challenge in online environments, impacting women adversely by creating barriers to accessibility and fostering unwelcoming spaces. Moreover, it perpetuates social inequalities and injustices. While automated tools have been developed to detect and evaluate sexist content on a large scale, many only offer broad classifications without detailed explanations. By not only identifying sexist content but also providing insights into why it is considered as such, these tools can enhance interpretability, foster trust, and promote understanding of automated decision-making processes. This approach empowers both users and moderators, fostering a more inclusive and accountable online community.
